# Building ARInsuretech

# Course aims
- Friction reduction & ProTips
- Context and core concept explanation
- Code to build upon
- Ideas for explorative projects

# Stack we're using
- Unity
- Vuforia  }  AR plugins
- EasyAR   }

## How to be a course builder
- Explore
- Keep good notes
  - Concepts you learned / misunderstood
  - Resources, articles, repos you found


# Build process
1. Choose something from the list that you're going to figure out
2. Announce it in #arinsuretech and tag the team e.g. "@course-builders I'm building object recognition in Unity" -> teaming up with others is a good idea
3. As you progress, dump any thoughts, struggles, realizatons, resources and code snippets in that thread. Just blab away, don't self-censor.
4. If you're stuck, ping in Slack e.g. "@course-builders can somebody help me figure out world-space camera angles?"
5. When you discover something cool, call Dan and the team over to see!
6. When you have a working prototype, create a new GitHub repo and push the code. Then announce your success to the team on Slack with a link to the repo!


# Things to build / figure out

## "Learn Root flow in AR" app

### High priority
- Interacting with Root API via Unity in JS
  - Directly in Unity, or
  - via a proxy e.g. ngrok
- Augmenting a virtual cap onto player's head (or other virtual swag if that's too complex)
- Forms for input in Unity

### Low priority
- 
- 

## Prep activities

### Root insurance modules
- list goes here

## Stretch goals
- Recognizing people from a set of many polaroids (for the Maker wall)
