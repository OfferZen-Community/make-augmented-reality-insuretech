# Building ARInsuretech

Thanks for contributing to Make's new course - you're awesome ðŸŒˆ 

# Course aims
Help future makers, by:
- Friction reduction & compiling ProTips
- Explaining core concepts in AR and Insurance
- Providing code to reference and build upon
- Coming up with ideas for late-day creative projects

# Stack we're using
- Unity
- Vuforia  } AR
- EasyAR   } plugins

## How to be a course builder
- Explore
- Keep good notes
  - Concepts you learned / misunderstood
  - Resources, articles, repos you found


# Build process
0. Communicate as much as possible!
1. Choose something from the list that you'd like to figure out
2. Announce in #arinsuretech and tag the team e.g. "@course-builders I'm building object recognition in Unity" -> teaming up with others is a good idea
3. As you progress, dump any thoughts, struggles, realizatons, resources and code snippets in that thread. Just blab away, don't self-censor.
4. If you're stuck, ping in Slack e.g. "@course-builders can somebody help me figure out world-space camera angles?" If somebody helps you past a blocker, record it.
5. When you discover something cool, call Dan and the team over to see!
6. When you have a working prototype, create a new GitHub repo and push the code. Then announce your success to the team on Slack with a link to the repo!


# Things to build / figure out

## "Learn Root flow in AR" app

This AR app will be given to makers to learn the Root Insurance flow, from quoting through to claiming, inside a fun AR context. The goal is to provide a working AR app that

### High priority
- Interacting with Root API via Unity in JS
  - Directly in Unity, or
  - via a proxy e.g. ngrok
- Augmenting a virtual cap onto player's head (or other virtual swag if that's too complex)
- Forms for input in Unity

### Low priority
- Swag destruction animations
- 

## Point and insure app

This AR app will be 

- Object recognition

## Prep activities

### Root insurance modules
- list goes here

## Stretch goals
- Recognizing people from a set of many polaroids (for the Maker wall)
