# Make a Make Day: Augmented Reality Insuretech

**The course we're making:** [Build an Augmented Reality app on Root Insurance](http://make.offerzen.com/course/root-insurance-augmented-reality)

Join us at the [Cape Town Make Space](https://www.google.com/maps/place/OfferZen+Make+Space+Cape+Town/@-33.9409935,18.398619,13z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1scape+town+make+space!3m4!1s0x1dcc676e2bcd3357:0xc1f861e358f0217e!8m2!3d-33.9277577!4d18.4124513) on **Saturday 4 August** to alpha-test the course and explore different tech stacks and AR ideas.

The Make Space will be open all day - at **9am we'll be discussing goals for the day**, so it would be great to have you around for that. If you can't make it in the morning, you're still welcome to pop in for a few hours later in the day. We'll have delicious food and drinks available throughout :)


### How Make builds courses

The community of Make developers is actively involved in building each new course. As an early contributor, you'll be helping test AR tech stacks, try out Root's numerous insurance modules, dream up and build creative AR and insurance project ideas, and figure out how to make the learning experience awesome and worthwhile for future makers. You'll also get to hang out with a cool group of AR/Insuretech enthusiasts :)
