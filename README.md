# Make a Make Day: Augmented Reality Insuretech

**The course we're making:** [Build an Augmented Reality app on Root Insurance](http://make.offerzen.com/course/root-insurance-augmented-reality)

Join us at the [Cape Town Make Space](https://www.google.com/maps/place/OfferZen+Make+Space+Cape+Town/@-33.9409935,18.398619,13z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1scape+town+make+space!3m4!1s0x1dcc676e2bcd3357:0xc1f861e358f0217e!8m2!3d-33.9277577!4d18.4124513) on **Saturday 4 August** to alpha-test the course and explore different tech stacks and AR ideas.

The Make Space will be open all day - at **9am we'll be discussing goals for the day**, so it would be great to have you around for that. If you *really* can't make it in the morning, you're welcome to pop in for a few hours later in the day.


### How Make builds courses

The community of Make developers is actively involved in building each new course. As an early contributor, you'll be helping build AR and Root activities that make the learning experience awesome and worthwhile for future makers, and dreaming up creative AR and Insurance project ideas to take the learning further. You'll also get to hang out with a cool group of AR/Insuretech enthusiasts, and we'll have delicious food and drinks available throughout :)


### Tech we'll be exploring

- [Root programmable insurance](https://root.co.za/insurance)
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com) and [Vuforia engine](https://www.vuforia.com/engine.html)


### What to bring

- Your laptop
- Your cellphone
- Any tablets or extra devices you'd like to play with
- All your friends


### Preparing for the day

- If you haven't already signed up, register your Make account at [make.offerzen.com](https://make.offerzen.com) and then [whatsapp Dan](https://wa.me/27760798924) to receive your invitation to Root Insurance and Make Slack.
- On your laptop, install Unity, Vuforia, and any extra components you want e.g. Android build or iOS build depending on what device you want to deploy to. If you're deploying to iOS, make sure you have [XCode installed](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)


### Helpful resources

- [Getting started with Vuforia in Unity](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html)
- [ARToolkit for Unity](https://github.com/artoolkit/arunity5)
- [Augmented Reality in 10 lines of HTML](https://medium.com/arjs/augmented-reality-in-10-lines-of-html-4e193ea9fdbf)


### What we'll be building

- Point-and-insure gadget insurance (better than Pineapple)
- AR filters to superimpose Root-branded clothing and creative destruction animations
- World-space UI forms for completing Root insurance steps

- Augmenting the maker photo wall to interactive / add personal quotes by detecting Maker faces using image targets
- Detecting cozmo cube targets to generate virtual cars that can be driven around by hand and crash into each other
- A portal in the Make Space. Bonus points if it connects to a cool video feed like live ISS footage
